# Simple Counter using Foundry

This is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that implements a basic counter functionality. The contract allows you to increment, decrement, and set the counter value. To deploy and interact with this contract using Foundry, follow the steps below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://foundry.finance/): Foundry is a platform that simplifies the process of deploying and managing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Ensure you have access to Foundry before proceeding.

### Deployment

1. Deploy the Smart Contract:

   - Access the Foundry platform and navigate to the Smart Contract deployment section.
   - Copy and paste the Solidity code provided in the contract file (Counter.sol) into the Foundry editor.
   - Configure the contract deployment parameters as needed.
   - Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Interact with the Smart Contract:

   - Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the functions provided.

## Contract Functions

### `setNumber(uint256 newNumber)`

- Allows changing the counter value.

#### Parameters

- `newNumber` (uint256): The new value to set for the counter.

### `increment()`

- Increments the counter by 1.

### `decrement()`

- Decrements the counter by 1.
